the program for graham's scan was written in Java.

the source files are in the src folder.

Provide the file path of the files to be tested in the java console window when prompted for the same. In eclipse IDE, the pathc an be copy pasted from the directory of the files, not sure about the other IDEs though.

The input should be a full path like :
C:\Users\pcname\docaddress\filename.txt

The output would be a console log of all the points comprising the convex hull.

The source file to be run is labelled main.java, but point.java is also a dependant class used in main.java
